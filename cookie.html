  <h1>Double Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
  <h3>INGREDIENTS: </h3>
<pre>

1/2 cup (100g) refined coconut oil, packed, not melted*

2/3 cup (140 g) brown sugar, packed 

 

3 Tbsp (45 mL) maple syrup

 

1/2 cup (125mL) plant-based milk such as soy

1/3 cup (35g) cocoa powder

1 Tbsp (15 mL) pure vanilla extract

1/2 tsp espresso powder or instant coffee granules (optional)

 

1 tsp (4 g) baking powder

3/4 tsp (3 g) baking soda

1/2 tsp salt

 

2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour

1 cup (150 g) dairy-free dark chocolate, chopped**

 

Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 F/ 180 C. 

Using a fork, cream together the coconut oil and brown sugar in a large bowl. Then add the maple syrup and mix until well combined. Add the milk, cocoa powder, vanilla, and instant coffee granules, whisking until combined. Then add the baking powder, baking soda and salt and again whisk until well combined. If the mixture looks clumpy, it’s okay! Note: if the temperature is warm where you are, you may want to consider chilling this mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up; otherwise the cookies flatten and spread too much when baking in the oven.

Add the flour to the bowl and stir until just-combined (do not over stir). Then gently fold in the chopped chocolate. 

Form little balls out of the dough and evenly distribute, about 5 cm (2 inches) apart, on a cookie sheet lined with baking paper. Pro tip: I like to reserve a bit of the chopped chocolate to sprinkle on the top for presentation. 

Bake for 12- 15 minutes, or until edges are lightly golden and the tops look set. Cool 1 minute on cooking sheet before transferring to cooling rack to cool completely. Enjoy

Notes

*If your coconut oil is liquid, chill in the fridge for a few minutes for it to solidify. 

** Reserve a small amount of the chopped chocolate to place on the cookies before baking for presentation. 

Variations: feel free to add cinnamon or chopped nuts to this recipe if desired.
