  <h1>Pasta with Vegan Bolognese Sauce</h1>
  <h3>INGREDIENTS: </h3>
<pre>Pasta

2.5 cups (210g) uncooked penne (GF if desired)  

1 tsp (5mL) olive oil

1 small onion, thinly sliced

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 cup (200g) PUL vegan tofu chorizo (or store-bought vegan chorizo or mock minced meat)

1 red bell pepper, chopped 

3/4 cup (130g) pitted green olives 

1/2 cup (100g) oil-packed artichoke hearts, drained, quartered

1/3 cup (20g) oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained, chopped

2 cups (500 g) tomato pasta sauce 

10 cherry tomatoes, whole or halved 

1 tsp (5g) dried oregano 

Salt and pepper to taste 
 

INGREDIENTS: Optional Garnish

1/4 cup (35g) roasted pine nuts

1/4 cup (6g) fresh basil

Fresh arugula

Thinly sliced scallions (green onions) 
 

<h3>Directions</h3>

Cook pasta according to package directions. 

In a large skillet on high, add the oil, onion and garlic and cook for two minutes. Add the vegan chorizo, bell pepper, olives, artichokes and sun-dried tomato and cook for another two minutes. Finally, add the pasta sauce, oregano, cherry tomatoes, salt and pepper. When hot and bubbling, remove from heat. 

Top drained pasta with chorizo mixture. Garnish and enjoy!
 

<h3>Notes</h3>

Variations: there are already mushrooms in our PUL vegan chorizo, but if you’d like you can add more mushrooms to this recipe. If so, add it after the onion and garlic and cook until the water evaporates, about 7 minutes. Add other spices of your choosing, such as dry basil or paprika powder. 

Up the Nutrition: by using whole grain penne pasta, upping the fibre.

Storage: store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.
