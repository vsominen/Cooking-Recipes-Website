  <h1>Vanilla Berry Chia Seed Pudding</h1>
  <h3>INGREDIENTS: </h3>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS: Chia Pudding

1 cup (250 ml) plant-based milk (coconut, soy, almond)

3 Tbsp (45g) chia seeds

1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract 

1/8 tsp cinnamon (optional) 

 

INGREDIENTS: Optional Add-ins

1/2 cup plant-based yogurt (I used soy yogurt)

1/2 cup homemade granola (or use store-bought) 

1 Tbsp maple syrup (optional)

Fresh fruit of your choice (I used strawberries, blueberries and peach) 

 

Directions

In a medium bowl, gently whisk together plant milk, chia seeds and vanilla, then let it stand for 10 minutes before giving it another stir to redistribute the settled seeds. Then cover and refrigerate for 2 hours (or overnight) to allow the chia seeds to gel. 

When ready to serve, give it one more stir before topping with plant-based yogurt, fresh fruit and granola, or other toppings of your choice. Enjoy
 

Notes

Variations: try it with different plant-based milks to see which flavour you like best, such as coconut milk, almond milk, or soy milk. Add in about 1 Tbsp of cocoa powder if you like it a little chocolate-y. For some zest, add orange juice or orange zest to the seeds before refrigerating. Try different fruits like banana, mango or kiwi. As you can see, this is a very versatile recipe! 

Storage: store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
