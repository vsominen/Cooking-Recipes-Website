  <h3>INGREDIENTS: </h3>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS: Smoothie

1.5 cups (375 mL) light coconut milk from can

1 cup (250mL) unsweetened plant milk (I used soy) 

2 frozen bananas 

1 cup (245g) pineapple chunks, fresh or frozen

1 cup (30-40g) packed spinach or use de-stemmed kale leaves (I used half a cup of each) 

4 (80g) medjool dates

2 Tbsp (30g) hemp seeds

1.5 tsp (7g) matcha powder

 

INGREDIENTS: Optional Toppings

Raw or roasted coconut flakes*

Blueberries

Strawberries

 

Directions

Blend in high-speed blender until well combined. Serve in a tall glass or in a bowl with desired toppings. Enjoy!

 

Notes

*I dry roasted my raw coconut flakes in a pan on high heat, continuously stirring until lightly golden and fragrant, about 3-5 minutes. Take it off the heat before it’s fully golden, as it continues to roast even after removed from the pan. 

Variations: add vanilla extract, an orange, mango or any other tropical fruit of your choosing.
