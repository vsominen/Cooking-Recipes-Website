  <h1>Autumn-Glow-Nourish-Bowl</h1>
  <h3>INGREDIENTS: </h3>
<pre>INGREDIENTS: The Bowl

1.5 cups (260 g) dry quinoa, rinsed

1 vegetable bouillon cube (or use 1.5 L vegetable broth)

 

1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable or olive oil 

1 red onion, thinly sliced

2 cloves garlic, minced

3 medium sweet potatoes, cut into 2cm cubes

2.5 cups (350 g) Brussels spouts 

 

2 cups (60 g) leafy greens of choice

1/3 cup (45 g) roasted almonds, coarsely chopped 

1/4 cup (45 g) pomegranate seeds  

2 Tbsp (15 g) dried cranberries 
INGREDIENTS: The Sauce

1/4 cup (60mL) tahini 

3 Tbsp (45mL) water

1 tsp (5g) miso paste (or substitute soy sauce)

1 tsp (5g) dijon mustard

1/2 tsp turmeric powder 

1/2 lemon, juiced

1/2 tsp onion powder

freshly cracked black pepper, to taste 

 

Directions

Preheat the oven to 425 F / 220 C.

Toss the oil, onion, garlic, sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts in a baking dish lined with baking paper and bake in the oven until cooked to your liking, about 50 minutes, stopping halfway to stir. 

Place quinoa in a pot with 2+1/4 cup (560 mL) water. Crush in the bouillon cube, bring to a bowl then reduce heat to low, partially cover, and allow to cook for 15-20 minutes until liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is al dente. 

Add the sauce ingredients to a food processor and blend (or add to a bowl and whisk) until well combined. 

To create your bowl add greens, quinoa, and baked veggies. Sprinkle on the almonds, pomegranate seeds, and cranberries. Drizzle on the sauce and enjoy!

Notes

*Speed-it-up: you can speed up this recipe by pan cooking the veggies instead of roasting. Simply cook the onion and garlic in the oil on high heat for about 3 minutes until fragrant, then lower to medium-high, add the sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts with a splash of water, cover with the lid and allow to cook until soft, about 15-20 minutes. 

Variations: add any other veggies you’d like, such as red bell peppers or zucchini. Change up the dressing by using balsamic vinegar instead of lemon, or ground cumin instead turmeric. You can also accompany this dish with some store-bought or homemade hummus. The options are endless!

Make-ahead: bake the roasted veggies or cook the quinoa ahead of time for a quick nourish bowl you can whip together in the following days. 

Storage: store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to four days; keep the sauce stored separately for up to 3 days.
